Todo

- Output the array in bytes
- Could loop through and calculate the length of each value
	- Each col needs a largest value,
	- start by counting the number of headings that there are
	- create an array/vec of the same length, all of the value should be three <- this is the smallest value a col should be
	- loop through each line and if the length of the word is greater than the stored value then replace it
- Each of the lines should be padded to that length in the same array
- create an array of bytes that is padded to the length of the value stored in the array

- Could align all of the columns
- Possibly align the text
